\section{System Overview}
\subsection{Purpose}

% Why would I want to use Docks? 
\docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications
using lightweight virtualization. It provides a command line interface (CLI)
and RESTful API. Maintaining and deploying applications often involve multiple
people. Providing multiple people access to the \docker CLI requires
Secure Shell access (SSH) as root to the server running \docker. If the server
is secure it will only provide SSH access using public/private keys, which
reduces convenience and restricts access to devices that are SSH capable and
holds a private key. The \docker API lacks functions which are provided by
the CLI, so it cannot be used on its own.

The purpose of \docks is to provide a secure web user interface
for using \docker.

\subsection{Product Scope}

% Cool, you showed the limitations of Docker, now what can Docks do for me?
\docks will provide functionality in three areas
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Provide a secure* web user interface that enables using the
	      essential* functions exposed by the \docker API and CLI.
	\item Provide a secure API to allow third party services to integrate
	      with \docks and use \docker
	\item Send real time notifications to system administrators via Slack about
	      important events
\end{enumerate}

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Users}
\docks will appeal mainly to software developers and system administrators
with fundamental understanding of \docker. \docks will allow
them to deploy new applications with \docker as well as manage existing 
applications. With the web user interface they will be able to
update and troubleshoot applications using any web browser. They will
also be able to give access to the web user interface to other administrators
for assisting in management. It is assumed this category of users will
have knowledge on configuring applications to be deployed with \docker
and the ability to troubleshoot networks and applications.

\docks will also appeal to users that are interested in learning how
to use \docker. With \docks they can deploy pre-configured applications and
develop an understanding of the features provided by \docker using the 
web user interface. It is assumed these users know the basic \docker
terminology and can learn from the \docker documentation.

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
To understand the purpose of Docks and the benefits it provides we first need to describe what Docker is.

\begin{quotation}
	Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.

	- docker.com
\end{quotation}

While it is possible to manage a Docker Swarm using the provided Command Line Interface, it requires experience and access to a terminal. Docks will make it possible for graphical interface orientated users to manage a Docker Swarm.

\subsection{Product Functions}
A high level summary of the required functions provided by the graphical user interface.

\begin{itemize}
	\item All management and view operations require authentication and the correct authorization
	\item Fine-grain permission control for user accounts
	\item Account roles with different permissions
	\item View Docker Nodes that are part of the Swarm
	\item View Services that are running in the Swarm
	\item View Tasks running in the Swarm
	\item Start and stop services
	\item Remove services
	\item Deploy a Stack to the Swarm using a docker-compose file
	\item Deploy a Service to the Swarm
	\item View Networks in the Swarm
	\item View Volumes in the Swarm
	\item Deploy images from a private repository
\end{itemize}

\section{External Interface Requirements}
\subsection{Software Interfaces}
Since the frontend cannot securely interface with the Docker API, an intermediate interface will be developed (Docks API). The Docks API will communicate between the frontend (Docks-UI) and the Docker API. The Docks API will provide a simplified interface for interacting with the Docker API.

\section{System Features}
\subsection{Authentication and Authorization}
\subsubsection{Description}
Due to the power the Docks system exposes only Authorized users should be able to use the system.
Resources will be managed by Teams. Account roles are assigned in the context of a team, i.e A
user can be a Guest in one team and a Super User in another team.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item R1.1 The system shall allow an authorized user to interact with the Docks API
	\item R1.2 The system shall allow a user to perform actions only when they are authorized to do so.
	\item R1.3 The system shall provide a global administrative account role without restrictions
	\item R1.4 The system shall provide Teams
	\item R1.5 The system shall provide the ability to add Users to Teams
	\item R1.6 The system shall only allow a User to manage resources that are part of their team.
	\item R1.7 The system shall provide the following account roles within Teams: (Role (Permissions))
	      \begin{itemize}

		      \item R1.9.3 Update user password
		      \item R1.9.4 Set permissions as stated in R1.3
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Docker Swarm Management}
\subsubsection{Description}
Docks needs to provide features for managing the Docker Swarm. While it is already possible to fully mange the Docker Swarm using the Command Line Interface, Docks will provide a simplified web interface.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item R2.1 The system shall display all nodes in the swarm.
	\item R2.2 The system shall display all services running in the swarm.

		      \item R2.12.2 Stack (if deployed from Stack)
		      \item R2.12.3 Tasks running in the service
		      \item R2.12.4 State of the Service
		      \item R2.12.5 Image used to create the Service
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Architecture}
\subsection{Subsystems}
The Docks system consists of two main subsystems. The Docks API Server and the Docks UI.

\subsubsection{Docks API Server}
The Docks API Server acts as a middleman between the UI and the Docker API running on the Manager Node. The Docks API also adds a layer of authentication and session management over the Docker API.

\subsubsection{Docks UI}
Docks UI is the web interface for managing the Docker Swarm through the Docks API. It consumes the API provided by the Docks API server.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Architectural Structure}
The User Interface uses the Model View Controller architecture. Nodes and Containers have a data model. The user interacts with the view to manipulate the data model. The view is updated when the data model retrieves data using an N-Tier architecture. The 3-Tier architecture can be seen by the actor interacting with the view, the request is then delegated to the models, which in turn communicate with other objects to retrieve and set the required data from the Docker API server and Docker Swarm.
